# SyncSaberService
Automatically downloads Beat Saber maps

Based on SyncSaber by brian, https://github.com/brian91292/SyncSaber/.

This is currently a standalone application you can run to automatically download maps like the original SyncSaber did.

# Configuration
<p>The app's settings are in the SyncSaberService.ini file in the same folder as the executable</p>
<p>You must add your BeastSaber username and password if you want to download your bookmarks and following feeds.</p>
<p>You can either manually enter your Beat Saber game's folder or drag and drop the folder onto SyncSaberService.exe to provide your game directory.</p>
